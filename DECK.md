> # Reports:
> * Files reorganize to separate hook files and other files, hooks now moved to folder name hooks
> * `github_api_spike.md` was moved to root of the repo
> * `git-deck` templates were copied inside of `hooks/git-deck`
> > * **OBS!** It needs to update `git-deck` script to look for templates inside of the `hooks/git-deck`
> * A simple installer was developed to install git hooks and git-deck files
> > * To use the installer it needs to change the current path to the git folder that is planed to to use git hooks and got-deck
> > * The installer add almost all files to `.git/hooks` in the current git folder.
> > * A file name `.gitdefault` is copied to the git root folder
> > * A file named `git-deck-completion.sh` is copied to the HOME folder of the current user and then the file is sourced via `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`

> The goal of this card is to improve gut-deck integration with git.
> 
> # DOD (definition of done):
> Git message hook check cards before commit.
> Auto complete git messages suggestions based on ONGOING card.
> A new option to ignore message format is added to git hooks.
> All findings are documented

> - [ ] 3. Auto-complete for commit messages
> - [ ] 4. Auto add git-deck changes
> - [ ] 5. Add auto-tag
> - [ ] 6. Add other items to header (creator, user, date, start-time, done-time...)
> - [ ] 7. Auto time tracker
> - [ ] 8. Plan to make it possible to use as Scrum board
> - [x] 9. Add a flag to enable/disable adding changeId
> 
> # Reports:
> * Both `commit-msg-format.shinc` and `commit-msg-decklink.shinc` were updated
> * Now It support some new directions such as `--nocheck` to skip message format check
> * It also updated to look for settings inside of git root folder, it looks for a file named `.gitdefault`
> * `.gitdefault` has a format as below
> >```
> ># Card link pattern
> >deckLinkFlag=true
> >deckLinkAddr="https://github.com/<GITOWNER/ORG>/$(git rev-parse --show-toplevel)/blob/main
> >DECK.md#%BOARDID%-%CARDID%"
> >
> ># Message pattern
> >messagePattern='['[bB]*[0-9]-[cC]*[0-9]']'*
> >messagePatternErrMsg="A message should be started with a pattern like [B<board-id>-C<card-id>]"
> >
> ># Add change-Id
> >gerritChangeIdFlag=true
> >```
> > * **OBS!** in the file above the link address and other settings can be updated, the new hook support some variables such as `%BOARDID%` and `%CARDID%` that will be replaced when they are created through a commit.
> > * By default the hook check a git message (the 1st message) the pattern with the pattern defined in `.gitdefault` (`messagePattern`), if it's not matched , it will show an error and ask to fix it. To skip the pattern check, a direction named `--nocheck` should be passed to the commit via 2nd or grater message for example
> >>```
> >>git commit -m "my commit message without pattern" -m "--nocheck"
> >>```
> > * Adding change-Id (used by gerrit commits) can be skipped by passing `--nochangeid` as 2nd or later message
> >>```
> >>git commit -m "my commit message without pattern" -m "--nochangeid"
> >>#or skipping both pattern check and adding change-Id
> >>git commit -m "my commit message without pattern" -m "--nochangeid" -m "--nochangeid"
> >>```
> * There was some challenge to update git hooks, git hooks are `sh` based not `bash` and many statements that work on bash do not work on `sh`. For example it took a while to find a solution to read a multi-lines variable line-by-line though a loop.
