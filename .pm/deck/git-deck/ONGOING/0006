# DOD (definition of done):
An installer is developed and tested.
A README is added as a user guide.

# TODO:
- [x] 1. Reorganize files
- [x] 2. Develop a simple installer

# Reports:
* Files reorganize to separate hook files and other files, hooks now moved to folder name hooks
* `github_api_spike.md` was moved to root of the repo
* `git-deck` templates were copied inside of `hooks/git-deck`
> * **OBS!** It needs to update `git-deck` script to look for templates inside of the `hooks/git-deck`
* A simple installer was developed to install git hooks and git-deck files
> * To use the installer it needs to change the current path to the git folder that is planed to to use git hooks and got-deck
> * The installer add almost all files to `.git/hooks` in the current git folder.
> * A file name `.gitdefault` is copied to the git root folder
> * A file named `git-deck-completion.sh` is copied to the HOME folder of the current user and then the file is sourced via `.bashrc` and `.bash_profile`
