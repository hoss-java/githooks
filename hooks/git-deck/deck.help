## Detailed Behavior

### Initializing Project Management
When `initpm` is called, the function checks if the `.pm` directory already exists. If it doesn't, it creates the directory and copies the specified template file into it. If it already exists, an informative message is printed.

### Editing Project Management
The `editpm` command opens the `pm.md` file in the specified editor (or default editor if not specified). If the file does not exist yet, an error message will be displayed.

### Initializing Deck
The `initdeck` command initializes the deck directory. If it already exists, a message indicating that it is already initialized will be shown.

### Creating the Deck File
The `createdeck` function compiles information from each board, column, and card into a `DECK.md` file formatted as Markdown. It extracts headers and other metadata from the cards, organizes them, and writes to the output file.
